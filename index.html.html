	<h1> This is a little about me </h1>
<p> A little about me is that I'm from Republic and 
I play video games probably way too much but it keeps me sane. My life hasn't been all that exciting 
I never played football, baseball (except little league) otherwise I go to school,
 I go home and just get through the rest of the day. I am a career center student but I'm ready to learn what there is to 
 learn because I'm hoping to get to game development and hopefully one day work for someone as big as Treyarch or Sony
